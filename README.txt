2014-05-02:  Declaring .emacs bankruptcy

After almost 20 years of accretion, my .emacs has gotten to the point
where trying to organize it would be far more effort than just nuking
it from orbit and starting fresh.  While I'm at it, I decided to use
this as an opportunity to get better acquainted with git and actually
use github.  Also to take advantage of the fact that modern emacs has
the ~/.emacs.d convention and better support for modular configuration
than when I started.  (Or at least, I'm a whole lot more motivated to
be organized about it now than I was BITD.)
